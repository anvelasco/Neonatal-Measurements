# Neonatal-Measurements
The full implemented codes used for both taking the measurements from neonatal patients and showing them in a GUI of my own design. Used and designed for the Kangaroo baby program as a way to non invasively collect measurements from patients for a fast response.

This was developed as parto of the Human Center Design with the Universidad de La Sabana in Chia, Cundinamarca, Colombia as part of my graduation project. It was designed by me, Alejandro Noriega alongside Cristian Rios and Oscar Lopez as students, Daniel Bohorquez as asistant and Mauricio Agudelo as director.
